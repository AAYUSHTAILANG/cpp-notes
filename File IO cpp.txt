		FILE HANDLING IN CPP
		====================

1)Modes of File Opening:
------------------------
There are different modes for opening a file, such as ios::in (input), ios::out (output), ios::binary (binary mode), std::ios::app (append), etc.

2)File Stream Objects:
----------------------
ifstream -> for reading from a file
ofstream -> for writing to a file
fstream  -> for both reading and writing.

3)EOF (End-of-File) Indicator:
------------------------------

The eof() function is used to check whether the end of a file has been reached.

returns NON-ZERO when eof reached.

4)Flush and Sync:
-----------------
The flush() function is used to flush the output buffer, and sync() is used to synchronize the associated file buffers.

5)File Position Pointers:
-------------------------
I)Get Pointer -> INPUT operations (READING)

-The get pointer is associated with input operations (reading from a file).
-Functions related to the get pointer include:
	i)tellg(): Returns the current position of the get pointer.
	
	ii)seekg(pos): Moves the get pointer to the specified position pos in the file.

	iii)seekg(offset, direction): Moves the get pointer by the specified offset in the specified direction (beg, cur, end).

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ifstream inputFile("example.txt");

    // Get the current position of the get pointer
    std::streampos currentPosition = inputFile.tellg();
    std::cout << "Current Position: " << currentPosition << std::endl;

    // Move the get pointer to a specific position
    inputFile.seekg(10); // Move to the 10th character
    std::cout << "New Position: " << inputFile.tellg() << std::endl;

    inputFile.close();
    return 0;
}

II)Put Pointer -> OUTPUT operations (WRITING)

-The put pointer is associated with output operations (writing to a file).
-Functions related to the put pointer include:
	i)tellp(): Returns the current position of the put pointer.

	ii)seekp(pos): Moves the put pointer to the specified position pos in the file.

	iii)seekp(offset, direction): Moves the put pointer by the specified offset in the specified direction (beg, cur, end).

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

int main() {
    std::ofstream outputFile("example.txt");

    // Get the current position of the put pointer
    std::streampos currentPosition = outputFile.tellp();
    std::cout << "Current Position: " << currentPosition << std::endl;

    // Move the put pointer to a specific position
    outputFile.seekp(20); // Move to the 20th character
    std::cout << "New Position: " << outputFile.tellp() << std::endl;

    outputFile.close();
    return 0;
}

reading from file  : >> (stream extraction operator)
